# Sorting-experiment
Here, I write and test some interesting sorting algorithm that may or may not be practical.

Further improvements will be made when I have time, including:
* Displaying program info
* Allow custom actions from user: 
  1. Pick the input data.
      * Unique/Random data.
      * Partial sorted data (%)
      * Reversely sorted data
      * Sorted data
      * User input data (input in terminal or via a input.txt with specific format)
  2. Do partial/full comparison.
      * Allow user to specify what to compare.
      * Compare everything.
      * In case of Bogo sort, set time out and tell user to change to smaller dataset.
  3. Do it again/exit
* Refactor the code to make it more organised and readable.
* Make this program serve an actual purpose except for being a joke.
